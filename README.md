Abstract	

In the current era marked by a rapid surge in technological advancements, the challenge of air pollution has intensified. However, prevailing studies on air quality analysis and prediction predominantly focus on individual locations, limiting their impact and applicability. Our unique approach aims to transcend this limitation by not only analyzing air quality levels but also correlating them with relevant health data, temperature levels, and other environmental stimuli.

Existing datasets often fall short, being either private, outdated, or lacking critical contextual information, such as county-level details. This endeavor seeks to establish collaborations across diverse domains, including healthcare, air quality teams, and beyond, fostering applicability in industries like pharmaceuticals. Leveraging a real-time API for data extraction within specific ranges, our approach ensures the timely detection of severity levels, enabling prompt reporting to emergency services and mitigating potentially fatal issues.
In this capstone project we explore how to build an aws data engineering pipeline to solve the issue by leveraging various aws solutions available To address these challenges effectively and assist governmental systems/organizations, we have devised a comprehensive process for data collection. This process involves mining information from large, archived datasets encompassing air quality, healthcare, and temperature data, as well as real-time API, and also draw insights using our data warehouse to develop better insights to business decisions.We would like to use aws cloud services to develop  our project as the project can be scalable and can be reused as per the requirement.
